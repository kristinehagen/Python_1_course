"""
Problem 1: Printing variables and simple mathematical operations
In the following problem you will be asked to combine knowledge about strings and mathematical operators.
"""

print("EXAMPLES")
# Example 1. Print integer
integer = 5
print(integer)

# Example 2. Print float
float = 5.5
print(float)

# Example 3. Print string
name_of_company = "Spacemaker"
print(name_of_company)

# Example 4. Combine multiple variables in print statement
first_name = "First"
last_name = "Last"
age = 40
print("Name: " + first_name + " " + last_name + ", age: " + str(age))
print()


# Task 1.1 - Print the sum of variables
a = 4
b = 6
print("TASK 1.1")
print("The sum of a and b is ")


# Task 1.2 - Make the print statement flexible so that a change in the variable
# "first_name" and "last_name" actually changes the print statement
first_name = "Kari"
last_name = "Hansen"
print("TASK 1.2")
print("My first name is Kari and my last name is Hansen")


# Task 1.3 - Create a currency calculator that prints for example: "300 NOK = 29.59 EUR"
nok = 300
euro_to_nok = 10.139
print("TASK 1.3")
